    "\n",
    "### **1) What is the fundamental principle behind the operation of a Hopfield Network?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental principle behind a **Hopfield Network** is **associative memory** or **content-addressable memory**. It stores patterns and retrieves them when presented with noisy or incomplete versions of those patterns. The network works by minimizing an energy function; stable patterns correspond to local minima of this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2) Explain the process of storing vectors in a Hopfield Network. How are the weights adjusted to accommodate these vectors?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To store vectors (patterns) in a Hopfield Network:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assume binary patterns $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\{-1, +1\\}^n$\n",
    "* For each pattern $\\mathbf{x}^{(p)}$, the weights $w_{ij}$ are updated using the **Hebbian learning rule**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  w_{ij} = \\sum_{p=1}^{P} x_i^{(p)} x_j^{(p)} \\quad \\text{for } i \\neq j,\\quad w_{ii} = 0\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "* This means the weight between two neurons increases if their activations are correlated in the training patterns.\n",
    "* The weights are symmetric: $w_{ij} = w_{ji}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3) Describe the recall process in a Hopfield Network. How does the network retrieve stored patterns?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An initial input (possibly noisy or incomplete) is given to the network.\n",
    "2. Neurons update their states asynchronously or synchronously using:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   x_i = \\text{sign} \\left( \\sum_{j} w_{ij} x_j \\right)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "3. The network evolves over time to minimize the energy function.\n",
    "4. Once the state stops changing (reaches equilibrium), the resulting pattern is the recalled (stored) pattern closest to the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process enables **auto-association**, recovering a complete pattern from partial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4) What are the limitations of a Hopfield Network in terms of the number of patterns it can store?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The network can reliably store and recall approximately **0.15 \\* N** patterns, where $N$ is the number of neurons.\n",
    "* If more patterns are stored:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Spurious states** (unwanted stable states) appear.\n",
    "  * The recall accuracy **decreases**.\n",
    "  * **Pattern interference** occurs, especially when stored patterns are not orthogonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5) Discuss the concept of energy in the context of a Hopfield Network. How is energy related to the stability of stored patterns?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hopfield Network defines an **energy function**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j} w_{ij} x_i x_j\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* The network updates neuron states in a way that **decreases the energy**.\n",
    "* **Stable patterns** (memorized patterns) correspond to **local minima** of the energy function.\n",
    "* Once the network reaches a minimum energy state, it **stops updating**, indicating that the pattern has been successfully recalled.\n",
    "* Energy ensures convergence and prevents infinite loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "Let me know if you want a Python simulation example of Hopfield Networks for better understanding!\n",
